# Sidemark for VS Code

**Sidemark** brings MRSF review comments directly into Visual Studio Code — add, manage, navigate, and reanchor comments without ever leaving your editor or touching your Markdown source files.

## Install

Search for **"Sidemark"** in the VS Code Extensions view, or install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wictor.mrsf-vscode).

**Requirements:** VS Code 1.85+ · Git recommended (enables commit-based staleness detection and diff-based reanchoring)

## Features

### Gutter Icons & Inline Highlights

Every commented line gets a color-coded gutter icon:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 💬 | Open comment(s) |
| ✅ | All resolved |
| ⚠️ | Orphaned anchor |
| 🔢 | Multiple comments on the same line |

Inline/column-span comments are highlighted directly in the editor text with a subtle background color.

### Inline Preview Text

Each commented line shows a compact inline preview — similar to how GitLens shows blame annotations — displaying the author and a snippet of the comment text right next to the code.

### Rich Hover Cards

Hover over any commented line to see the full comment thread with author, timestamp, status badges, and one-click action links:

- **Resolve / Unresolve** — toggle comment state
- **Reply** — add a threaded reply
- **Delete** — remove the comment

### Sidebar Panel

A dedicated **Sidemark** activity-bar panel lists all comments for the active Markdown file:

- Sort by **line number** or **date**
- Toggle **resolved comments** visibility
- Filter to show **unresolved only**
- Navigate to any comment with a single click
- **Reanchor** all comments from the sidebar
- Orphaned comments are highlighted with a warning badge and count
- Add new comments directly from the panel

### Automatic Reanchoring on Save

When you save a Markdown file, Sidemark silently reanchors all comments using the MRSF multi-step resolution algorithm:

1. **Exact text match** — finds the selected text at any position
2. **Fuzzy match** — handles minor edits with configurable threshold
3. **Diff-based shift** — uses git diffs for precise line shifting
4. **Line fallback** — falls back to positional anchoring

High-confidence results are applied automatically; uncertain results are flagged for manual review.

### Interactive Reanchor Review

Run **Sidemark: Reanchor Comments** from the command palette for a guided review session. Each uncertain result is shown with old/new anchor decorations and accept/reject/skip controls.

### Anchor Drift Detection

When you insert or delete lines, the status bar warns that comment anchors may have drifted. Saving the file clears the warning after reanchor runs.

### Staleness Warnings

If any comments reference a different git commit than HEAD, the status bar shows an orange warning with the count of stale comments. Click to reanchor.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `Sidemark: Add Line Comment` | Add a comment on the current line |
| `Sidemark: Add Comment on Selection` | Add an inline comment on the selected text |
| `Sidemark: Reply to Comment` | Reply to an existing comment |
| `Sidemark: Resolve Comment` | Resolve a comment (with optional cascade) |
| `Sidemark: Unresolve Comment` | Unresolve a previously resolved comment |
| `Sidemark: Delete Comment` | Delete a comment |
| `Sidemark: Reanchor Comments` | Run interactive reanchor for uncertain results |
| `Sidemark: Go to Comment` | Navigate to a comment's anchor position |
| `Sidemark: Refresh Comments` | Reload the sidecar from disk |

All commands are also available from the editor context menu (right-click) on Markdown files.

## Settings

All settings are under the **Sidemark** section in VS Code Settings.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sidemark.author` | `string` | `""` | Default author name for new comments |
| `sidemark.showResolved` | `boolean` | `true` | Show resolved comments in decorations and sidebar |
| `sidemark.gutterIcons` | `boolean` | `true` | Show gutter icons for commented lines |
| `sidemark.inlineHighlights` | `boolean` | `true` | Show inline background highlights for text-specific comments |
| `sidemark.reanchorOnSave` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically reanchor comments on save |
| `sidemark.reanchorThreshold` | `number` | `0.6` | Fuzzy match threshold for reanchoring (0.0–1.0) |
| `sidemark.reanchorAutoAcceptScore` | `number` | `1.0` | Auto-accept reanchor results at or above this confidence |

## How It Works

Sidemark stores review comments in **sidecar files** alongside your Markdown documents, following the [MRSF v1.0 specification](/specification):

```
docs/
  architecture.md                    ← your document
  architecture.md.review.yaml       ← sidecar with comments
```

Comments are anchored to specific lines or text ranges using `line`, `end_line`, `start_column`, `end_column`, and `selected_text`. When the document is edited, the reanchor algorithm relocates comments automatically.

## Alternate Sidecar Location

Place a `.mrsf.yaml` at your repository root to store sidecars in a central directory:

```yaml
sidecar_root: .reviews
```

With this config, the sidecar for `docs/architecture.md` resolves to `.reviews/docs/architecture.md.review.yaml`.
